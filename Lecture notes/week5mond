CIA contd

Authentication
	real life - seeing someone's face?
		twins
		tom cruise
		lack of lack
		you see what you expect to see

	impossible
		computer is trying to achieve something that is outisde the computer

	way of authenticating - factors
		first factor - something you know
			vuln to man in the middle
			can be leaked
			used once?

		second factor - something you have
			e.g. card
			can be forged
			expensive sometimes
			chips can be reverse engineered, brute forced, software can be stolen
			nature of the card has to be converted to information so computer knows you have the card
			 - don't actually need anything physical to atack the system

		thrid - something you are
			e.g. the way you walk
			fingerprint
			 - again more information
			 - fingerprint sensor many ways to beat e.g. breathing on sensor
			can't change these secrets
				if they get stolen they are stolen forever

		2FA
			sms became 1FA because banking is also done on phones!
			sim tray is not locked
			clone sim is easy - secret of the sim card

Integrity
	compute if its been changed in someway

	using hashing
		pre-image attacks
			being able to compute the input from the hash

		MD5 - SHA0 SHA1 2 3
		MD5
			


end to end
	one of the end is the real world
		very hard to defend

type1 type2 errors on authentication
	e.g. not recognising own fingerprint
