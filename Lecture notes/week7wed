Block and stream ciphers

padding orcacles

don't implement your own crypto

block cipher modes:
	Electronic codebook (ECB)
		standard encrypting with each key
		has problems
	counter encryption
		CTR - counter mode encryption
		encrypt a nonce not the plaintext??
	XOR with Vector initialiser first
		cipher block chaining (CBC)
		then XOR everything with previous ciphertext
	other one?
padding orcale attacks
	being able to pad to block size is hard

facebook keeps shadow profiles

CVEs - numbering system for vulnerabilities
 - get a CVE = extra marks
The essential 8
	people seem to always make the same mistakes
	e.g. 10 most common vulnerabilities
OWASP
	look it up

stargate ghost problem
	send people through the stargate
	literally untrusted medium (only one direction though)
