Sovereignty
	control over your own assets/supply chains
		can be cheaper to import from other countries
			this builds coupling
			can be dangerous (e.g. in a global pandemic if that ever happened)
		Tariffs
			tax imports:
				allows local business to compete with cheaper foreign business

e.g. consider rolling your own or outsorcing software
	AWS is a much more attractive target to a hacker
		probably also much more secure than anything you could write
	Writing it yourself allows you to control your own Sovereignty
		e.g. defence software (military) should be written by own country
