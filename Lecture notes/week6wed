command and control

cold war
	in 2nd world war president demanded that he be in control of nuclear launches

	have been 32 nuclear weapon accidents known as "broken arrows"
		since 1950

hard to enforce power all the way down
	live nuclear missiles left ungaurded in a warehouse

weapons safety
	everyone has to be able to know what weapons are being used

	type 1 / type 2 errors
		attention in cold war was getting nukes working
		not much attention on accidents

	pin codes
		bomb wouldn't explode unless the president tells the pin code
		-if phone lines go down then can't launch attack

leader/general/pharoah - strength of a million people but brains of 1
	better with discussion - more creative
		harder to get things done

corona
	china adopted a big command and control structure
		time of crisis - need type 1 structure
	america has a bit of chaos - everyone doing everything

buckland calls this:
	centralisation vs decantralisation

athens overthrew the king
	invented democracy
	kings seem to keep coming back
		need a boss to be in charge - but stop this boss taking more and more power

	athens appointed 2 people to be in power not just one

people in power will try to retain power
	putin doing it right now - trying to change russian constitution
	try to control media
	in aus we combat this by
		separating state and judiciary
		constitution
		govenor general

	aus public sector is being corroded
		MPs being appointed to lead external sectors

	TURKEY
		prime minister has managed to maintain power

Draconian laws - incredibly strict

Temporary dictator to solve a crisis
	possible solution for now?
	may result in dictatorship system after this is all over

Danger of a dictator is a sinlge point of failure
	problem is the top

Double entry bookkeeping
	2 ice cream servers - must corrupt both to cheat system
dual control system

everything goes in both books
	would have to change both books to cheat system

These days a lot of the double entry keeping is done in the same software, e.g. MYOB

also is dual control to stop errors (as well as corruption)
	like pair programming
	when checking read it backwards

watch the opening sequence to wargames - physical sequences and protocols
	dual control



Asset protection
	don't forget what you're trying to protect

checklist for identifying assets
	ask all the people in the organisation?
	regularly surveying the values of people of the involved in what you are protecting
	perioodically revise current list of assets

Uni assets
	Student data
	Money
	Intellectual property - research etc
	Buildings and infrastructure
	Reputation

	chemicals and materials
	communication channels
	staff and students themselves - humans!!! - safe practices

share registry - no more paper trails, everything is recorded electronically
coke - biggest asset is their brand

tangible assets:
	physical things
intangible assets
	secrets, employee morale and security
	reputation
	availability of services

assesing the value of an assets
	how much money would be lost if it went down for 24hrs
examples
	picasso painting
methods:
	how much someone else will pay for it
	how much you paid for it
	how much it would cost to replace
	if it generates income - how much it may generate in future
art frauds - a lot at the moment



hash revision
	preimage resistance: hard to find x from h(x)
	second preimage resistance: hard to find another input that has same output

Schneier: 
	hash should look like a random function

cryptographic functions are broken if there is a method to crack ciphers quicker than brute force
	anything quicker, even 1 bit less than brute force bits of work

birthday attack
	after about 23 people should find 2 people with the same birthday - birthday paradox
	if n possible birthdays, takes on average sqrt(n) people to ask until a collision
