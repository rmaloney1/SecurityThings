	detailed evaulation of all assets the company/firm wants to protext
		work out how much value each of these holds
		evaluate how much they are willing to spend to secure such assets
	compromise between convenience and security

	faster
	used for sending messages

	block cipher modes
		ECB - electronic code book

		compromise supplier or something the company uses
